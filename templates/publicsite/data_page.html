<h3>BYOP: Build Your Own Party (Data Pack)</h3>

<p>Here's where to get the real goods--all the underlying, raw data that the Sunlight Foundation has created based on fundraising invitations collected for the Party Time project. As we enter information on new invitations, the database is updated automatically.<p>
The database contains records of invitations for fundraisers and other events feting lawmakers and congressional candidates collected by the project from anonymous lobbyist sources and are displayed on our <a href="http://www.politicalpartytime.org">public website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Invitations gathered date back to 2006; however, most are from the 2008 calendar year when we began collecting invitations in earnest and launched this project (July 2008). The data are input by Sunlight interns and staffers. While we check for duplicate entries for particular events and errors, it is always worth checking the original source, the invitations for display on our website, for accuracy. 
</p>
<p>
Because these events are not required to be reported in any official manner, we only know about the events we've received information about. We encourage the public to send us more information about events. 
</p>
<p>
These documents are posted as a public service in the interest of creating more transparency about the relationships between lobbyists and lawmakers. Sunlight is not responsible for the content of the invitations themselves (including erroneous information) or for verifying whether the events advertised in the invitations actually occurred.
</p>
<p>There are several ways to get your Party Time data fix.</p>

You can find the JSON feed here: <a href="http://politicalpartytime.org/json/N00009668/">http://politicalpartytime.org/json/N00009668/</a> The last number represents a candidateID. You can determine a candidate ID by going to his or her profile page on Political Party Time. (IDs originate from the Center for Responsive Politics -- the nation's authority on campaign finance data.)</p>
